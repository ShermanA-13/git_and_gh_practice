Recent and memorable camping trip was going out to Joe's Valley, Utah.
A climbing mecca for people who climb boulders and met up with a large group of friends who had the same purpose of climbing and sharing good times.
There was an extremely scenic climb despite it being the dead of night.
A lot of good laughs and wonderful memories were made that night.
